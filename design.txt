This is the design document

There are a total of 3 classes in our solution:
1. Game
2. Picture
3. Player

The Player class:
Player has the following attributes:
1. String name: the name of the player
2. Picture picture: the picture that this player will guess
3. int playerNumber: the unique number of the player
Player has the following methods:
1. Player(): constructor that initializes the Player's attributes
2. void initPicture(): this initializes the picture by calling the initImage() method of the Picture class
3. void printPicture(): displays the picture on the screen by calling the printImage() method of the Picture class
4. void getInput(): gets the character that the user inputs as a guess
5. void playTurn(): this is the actual logic of a player guessing a character and the picture revealing itself

The Picture class:
Picture holds all the information about the word to be guessed along with the picture to reveal
Picture has the following attributes:
1. Vector<Vector<Character>> image: the image that will be revealed
2. Vector<Vector<Character>> guessedImage: the part of the image that gets guessed
3. String filepath: the file path of the image
4. String word: the word to guess
5. String guessedWord: the part of the word that has been guessed
6. int lettersRevealed: the number of letters that have been revealed
7. double percentRevealed: percent of the characters revealed
8. int totalCharacters: total characters in the image
Picture has the following methods():
1. Picture(): constructor that initializes the Picture's attributed
2. void initImage(): initializes image and guessedImage
3. void printImage(): prints guessedImage

The Game class:
This is the driver program 
Game has the following attributes:
1. Player me: object for player 1
2. Player you: object for player 2
3. int winner: stores the player number that wins
Game has the following methods:
1. Game(): initializes the objects me and you
2. String getWord(): Gets the word to be guessed from the input
3. void init(): initalizes the Pictures
4. void runGame(): has an infinite do-while loop that allows the players to play one by one

How all the classes work together:
The Game class creates two Player objects for the 2 players. Each Player object creates an object of the Picture class to store the picture which is guessed by that Player.
